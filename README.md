sshfs-tools
===========

Some bash scripts that help using sshfs manage mount remote file systems simple.

Getting Start
--------

First, you need install `sshfs`.

Maybe http://osxfuse.github.io/ or https://github.com/fuse4x/sshfs

To use these routines,

1. Copy `addfs` and `rmfs` to `/usr/local/bin`.
2. Copy `sshfs-tools.sh` to somewhere (e.g. ~/.sshfs-tools.sh).
3. Add the following line to your .bashrc: `source ~/.ssh-tools.sh`
4. Restart your bash

Then,

Run `addfs user@hostname:/path/to/somewhere` to mount remote file systems.

Run `rmfs hostname` to umount remote file systems.

Notes,

`addfs` history will be saved to auto-complete your remote file systems.

`rmfs` will also auto-complete current mounted remote file systems for you.
